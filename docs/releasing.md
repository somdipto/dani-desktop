# Releasing

Friend-machine first builds and agent steps: [`docs/packaging.md`](packaging.md).

For a normal release, run **Actions → Prepare next release → Run workflow** and
choose a patch, minor, or custom version. It opens a tiny version-bump PR;
merging that PR automatically starts **Release** and assembles a draft from the
exact merge commit. Review and publish the draft when it is ready.

The existing **Actions → Release → Run workflow** button remains available for
reruns and recovery. It
builds macOS (arm64 + x64, signed, notarized, stapled), Windows, and Ubuntu
from a single pinned commit, verifies every artifact the way a user would
receive it, and assembles the canonical draft in
[Dani Bot releases](https://github.com/somdipto/dani-desktop/releases).

Tick **publish** to publish immediately. Leave it unticked to review the
draft in GitHub's UI first.

The workflow refuses to overwrite an already-published version. Manual Release
runs still require `package.json`'s version to be bumped on the selected ref.
A release is rejected if any installer, stable download
name, updater feed, blockmap, size, or digest is absent or inconsistent.

GitHub generates the release body from pull requests since the previous
tag. Configure the optional Vercel hook below to rebuild the docs immediately
after publication; otherwise the next docs deployment refreshes it.


## Why the gates exist

Each verification step in `release.yml` maps to a real incident from the
hand-cut releases (0.1.15–0.1.25): stale build output breaking the code
signature, a bare import killing the packaged server on launch while every
check stayed green, helper paths resolving outside the app after bundling,
stapling silently invalidating every published hash, and a finished release
sitting invisible as a draft. Don't remove a gate without reading the comment
above it.

## One-time setup: release secrets

Set these in **the repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**.

The **Prepare next release** workflow also needs
**Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions → Allow GitHub Actions
to create and approve pull requests** enabled. The workflow only creates the
version PR; it never approves or merges it.

### 1. `MAC_CERT_P12_BASE64` + `MAC_CERT_PASSWORD`

The Developer ID Application certificate, exported from the Mac that
currently signs releases:

```sh
# Keychain Access → My Certificates → "Developer ID Application: Milind Soni
# (993D98NH4J)" → right-click → Export… → .p12 with a strong password, then:
base64 -i DeveloperID.p12 | pbcopy   # → MAC_CERT_P12_BASE64
# the export password             → MAC_CERT_PASSWORD
```

### 2. `APPLE_API_KEY_P8_BASE64` + `APPLE_API_KEY_ID` + `APPLE_API_ISSUER_ID`

An App Store Connect API key for notarization (better than an app-specific
password for CI — revocable, scoped, no 2FA dance):

1. [App Store Connect → Users and Access → Integrations → App Store Connect API](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/access/integrations/api)
2. Generate a **Team Key** with the **Developer** role
3. Download the `.p8` (one chance only), note the Key ID and Issuer ID

```sh
base64 -i AuthKey_XXXXXXXX.p8 | pbcopy   # → APPLE_API_KEY_P8_BASE64
```

### 3. Optional `DOCS_DEPLOY_HOOK_URL`

In Vercel, open the docs project and create a **Deploy Hook** for its production
branch. Store that private URL as the `DOCS_DEPLOY_HOOK_URL` repository secret.
Publishing a release then requests a fresh docs deployment so the generated
changelog appears immediately. Do not put the hook URL in source control.

### Local fallback

The hand-cut path still works when Actions is down or a release needs
surgery: `pnpm package:mac`, gate with `codesign --verify --deep --strict`,
notarize with the local keychain profile (`xcrun notarytool submit …
--keychain-profile AC_PASSWORD`), staple, re-zip, regenerate blockmaps and
`node scripts/regenerate-mac-feed.mjs`, then upload the assets and verify the
published bytes against the published feed by downloading them back.
