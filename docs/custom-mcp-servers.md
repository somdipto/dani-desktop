# Bring your own MCP servers

Open **Plugins → MCP servers → Add server** to give your bots tools from a
trusted local MCP server. Add the executable, put each argument on its own
line, and add any environment variables as `KEY=value`.

Dani Bot saves a new server switched off. Use **Test** to start it briefly,
complete the MCP handshake, and see the tools it advertises. Then turn it on.
It becomes available to compatible bots on their next task; no app restart is
needed.

This first version supports local stdio commands. It deliberately does not
accept remote MCP URLs or shell command strings.

## Advanced: edit the file

The same registry lives in `~/.danibot/config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "notes": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@example/notes-mcp"],
      "env": { "NOTES_TOKEN": "…" }
    }
  }
}
```

If you edit the file by hand, restart Dani Bot. Every bot whose engine can
mount custom MCP servers gets the enabled tools on its next task.

## Rules that keep this safe

- **Permission cards by default.** Custom servers are never pre-approved:
  on Claude their tools route through the permission broker into Allow/Deny
  cards; on Codex they keep the on-request approval policy; ACP engines
  relay the agent's own permission asks. Built-ins stay pre-quieted — only
  *your* servers ask.
- **Reserved names are refused** (`computer`, `agents`, `composio`,
  `browser`, `phone`, `dweb`, `ogb`, …) so a custom entry can never shadow
  a built-in tool surface. Names are lowercase letters/digits/`_`/`-`, max
  32 chars, starting with a letter.
- **One bad entry never takes the fleet down.** Invalid entries are skipped
  with a logged reason; the rest still mount.
- **Credentials are write-only in the UI.** The API returns environment names,
  never their values. Leaving an existing value blank keeps it saved; removing
  its line deletes it.
- **Credentials stay off argv.** `env` values travel in the child
  environment (Codex argv carries env *names* only; Claude uses the private
  0600 mcp-config file; ACP passes them in the session payload with the
  wire log redacted). They do persist as plaintext in the 0600 config file —
  prefer tokens scoped to the one server.
- **Testing is bounded.** The test command is stopped after the handshake (or
  eight seconds), its output is capped, and its stderr is never sent to the UI.
  It inherits none of Dani Bot's workspace or provider credentials; only
  the environment variables configured for that MCP server are added.
- `"enabled": false` parks an entry without deleting it.
- Stdio servers only for now — `url` transports are a planned follow-up and
  are skipped with a note.
