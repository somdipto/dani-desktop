// tools are:
//
//   list_bots()                          → the other bots in this section + their status
//   list_rooms()                         → the shared rooms this bot may post into
//   post_to_room(group_id, message)      → put ONE message in a room; nobody's
//                                          turn starts, so nobody replies
//   ask_bot(bot_id, msg)                 → send msg to that bot, wait, return its reply
//   delegate_bot(bot_id, msg, reason?)   → hand the task to a peer ASYNC: returns
//                                          immediately, the peer runs after your
//                                          current turn finishes, the result is
//                                          delivered to the source conversation
//   create_bot(name, role, instructions) → Chiefs can add a specialist to
//                                          their own section
//   request_credential(id, reason?)       → show a secure, allowlisted key card
//   list_routines()                       → inspect this bot's scheduled work
//   propose_routine(...)                  → show a confirmation card for a new routine
