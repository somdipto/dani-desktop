// Cross-platform process spawning for the agent CLIs. Four Windows
// differences are exposed to drivers through this module:
//   1. CreateProcess can't exec npm .cmd/.bat shims or node-shebang scripts
//      directly. env-path resolves those to their real .exe / `node script`
//      entry without a shell, so quoting-sensitive JSON argv stays intact.
//   2. No process-group kill (kill(-pid) is POSIX) — taskkill /T reaps the
//      whole tree, CLI + its spawned MCP proxies alike.
//   3. Console apps spawned from the GUI shell flash a console window
//      unless windowsHide is set.
//   4. CreateProcess has a 32,767-character command-line limit. Keep prompt
//      bodies on stdin or in private files and fail clearly if a future
//      driver accidentally puts one back in argv.
