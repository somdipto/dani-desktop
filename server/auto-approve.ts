// guards, while questions remain outside this module and always reach a human.

// The guard is deliberately tiny and literal. It is NOT a security
// boundary (an agent set on damage has a thousand spellings for `rm`);
// it is a "you probably didn't mean to hand THIS one over unattended"
// backstop for the obvious catastrophes. Real containment is the
// sandbox and the bot's own computer, not a regex.
