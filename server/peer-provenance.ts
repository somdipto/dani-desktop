// What a bot is told about text another bot wrote.
//
// Internal transport changes custody, not authorship. A line that arrives
// through ask_bot, or lands in a room through post_to_room, was written by
// a model — and the two published failures of not saying so are the same
// failure twice. Prompt Infection (arXiv:2410.07283) showed one injected
// instruction replicating agent to agent across exactly this kind of
// hand-off, and the Claude Code GitHub Action CVE came from a public issue
// body dressed up as an error message. Neither needed a compromised peer:
// only a reader that took relayed text for an instruction from its user.
//
// So every peer-authored line carries its authorship and a default that is
// cheap when it turns out to be unnecessary — information rather than
// instruction, and, where nobody is waiting on an answer, silence.
//
// The note opens with "[Message from @Name" or "[Posted by @Name" because
// the shape of the first few words is what a model actually keys on, and
// that marker has been in the ask path since peer comms shipped.
